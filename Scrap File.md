Score the most points or reach a certain score(roll three die):
Could it be easier to implement a > than function for greatest rolled score or use an = function to equate that with desired score?
If two die are rolled they are fixed and cannot be re-rolled, can choose to re-roll the third die for a higher score but risk “tupling” out(three of the same die means they lose) 
Would the player play three rounds and if they score above a certain score they get a corresponding rank? 
Like having a score 7 and below: you are _____ rank
If you roll three ones: you get an additional die which when rolled multiplies your score of three by the value rolled
A score 8-14, you are _____ rank
Score 15-17 you are expert rank 
Roll three six’s and you roll demon die, whatever number  you roll will subtract from your score and that will be your score 
Would the player enter their name each time?
